Interactive Periodic Table of Elements
Description:

This program is designed for educational purposes, particularly in the fields of chemistry and, to a lesser extent, molecular physics. The implementation of a molecular weight calculation function is also under consideration, but its inclusion will depend on the final project scope.

Controls:

Navigate the periodic table using arrow keys or WASD keys.
Switch between different table modes using PG_UP and PG_DN keys.
